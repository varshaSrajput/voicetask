This folder contains a small Python prototype that was created while exploring the task parsing logic. Before finalizing the JavaScript version for the main application, I experimented with parsing natural language in Python to understand different approaches.

The script demonstrates:
- extracting priority
- detecting status
- interpreting relative dates (“tomorrow”, “in 3 days”, “next Monday”)
- cleaning text to produce a task title

This prototype is standalone and not connected to the main app, but it reflects the initial exploration done in Python.
